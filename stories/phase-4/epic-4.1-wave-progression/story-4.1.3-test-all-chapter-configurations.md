## Testing Matrix

### Chapter 1: "First Contact"
**Overall Goal:** Tutorial chapter introducing basic mechanics

#### Wave 1: "Tutorial Wave"
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**Expected Behavior:**
- [x] Spawns only basic_circle_small zomboids
- [x] Count: 15 zomboids total
- [x] Spawn rate: 0.5 seconds between spawns
- [x] Columns: Both left and right
- [x] No timers spawn
- [x] Easy difficulty, survivable with single_gun

**Verification Steps:**
1. Start Chapter 1
2. Count zomboid spawns (should be 15)
3. Verify spawn rate (~2 zomboids per second)
4. Verify both columns used
5. Verify wave completes at 30 seconds
6. Check no timers appeared

**Balance Notes:**
- Spawn rate appropriate for tutorial? ______
- Difficulty too easy/hard? ______
- Duration too short/long? ______

---

#### Wave 2: "Introduction to Variety"
**Duration:** 45 seconds
**Expected Behavior:**
- [x] Spawns basic_circle_small (10 count, 0.4s rate, immediate)
- [x] Spawns basic_circle_medium (5 count, 0.3s rate, 5s delay)
- [x] Hero add timer spawns at 20s in left column
- [x] More zomboid variety than Wave 1
- [x] First timer mechanic introduction

**Verification Steps:**
1. Start Wave 2 from Chapter 1
2. Count small circles (10) and medium circles (5)
3. Verify spawn delays (medium circles start at 5s)
4. Verify timer appears at 20s in left column
5. Test shooting timer increments counter
6. Verify timer exit adds/removes heroes
7. Verify wave completes at 45s

**Balance Notes:**
- Is timer timing appropriate (20s into 45s wave)? ______
- Is hero count change noticeable? ______
- Difficulty increase appropriate? ______

---

#### Wave 3: "Escalation" (if exists in config)
**Check if Chapter 1 has a third wave**
- [x] Verify wave count in chapter-01.json
- [x] If exists, test similarly to Wave 2

---

### Chapter 2: "Rising Threat"
**Overall Goal:** Increased difficulty, multiple timer types

#### Wave 1: "Speed Increase"
**Duration:** 40 seconds
**Expected Behavior:**
- [x] Spawns basic_circle_small (20 count, 0.3s rate, immediate)
- [x] Spawns square_small (8 count, 0.4s rate, 5s delay)
- [x] Hero add timer at 15s in right column
- [x] Weapon upgrade timer at 25s in left column
- [x] Introduction of square zomboids
- [x] Multiple timer types active

**Verification Steps:**
1. Start Chapter 2 (verify Chapter 1 must be completed first)
2. Count circle zomboids (20) and square zomboids (8)
3. Verify both timers spawn at correct times
4. Test hero add timer functionality
5. Test weapon upgrade timer functionality
6. Verify weapon tier increases to double_gun
7. Verify increased spawn density feels harder than Chapter 1

**Balance Notes:**
