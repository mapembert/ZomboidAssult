## Bug Fixing Workflow

### Step 1: Triage and Prioritization

```markdown
1. Review all bug reports from testing
2. Categorize each by severity
3. Assign priority (P0-P3)
4. Estimate effort (small/medium/large)
5. Create fixing order:
   - P0 (Critical) first
   - P1 (Major) second
   - P2 (Minor) if time allows
   - P3 (Enhancement) to backlog
```

**Prioritization Matrix:**

| Severity | Impact | Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Critical | High | P0 | Fix immediately |
| Major | Medium-High | P1 | Fix before release |
| Minor | Low-Medium | P2 | Fix if time allows |
| Enhancement | Low | P3 | Post-launch |

---

### Step 2: Fixing Process

For each bug:

```markdown
1. **Reproduce the bug**
   - Follow steps to reproduce
   - Verify bug exists
   - Understand root cause

2. **Analyze the issue**
   - Check related code
   - Review error logs
   - Identify problematic logic

3. **Develop a fix**
   - Write minimal change to fix bug
   - Avoid introducing new bugs
   - Consider edge cases

4. **Test the fix**
   - Verify bug is fixed
   - Test related functionality
   - Check for regressions
   - Test on all platforms

5. **Document the fix**
   - Update bug report
   - Add code comments
   - Update CHANGELOG
   - Commit with descriptive message

6. **Close bug report**
   - Mark as "Fixed"
   - Add verification notes
   - Link to commit
```

---

### Step 3: Regression Testing

After each fix, test:

```markdown
- [ ] The specific bug is fixed
- [ ] Related functionality still works
- [ ] No new bugs introduced
- [ ] Performance not degraded
- [ ] All scenes still work
- [ ] Audio still works
- [ ] Quick smoke test (5 minutes)
```

## Common Bug Categories and Fixes

### 1. Collision Detection Bugs

**Common Issues:**
- Collisions not detected
- False positive collisions
- Collision callbacks not firing
- Performance issues with many collisions

**Typical Fixes:**
```typescript
// Issue: Destroyed objects still in collision checks
// Fix: Filter out destroyed objects
const activeZomboids = this.zomboids.filter(z => z.active);
this.physics.overlap(projectiles, activeZomboids, callback);

// Issue: Collision bounds incorrect
// Fix: Set proper bounds
zomboid.setSize(radius * 2, radius * 2);
zomboid.setCircle(radius);

// Issue: Callbacks not firing
// Fix: Ensure proper callback context
this.physics.overlap(a, b, this.onCollision, null, this);
```

---

### 2. Memory Leak Bugs

**Common Issues:**
- Event listeners not removed
- Tweens not destroyed
- Sounds not cleaned up
- Graphics not cleared

**Typical Fixes:**
```typescript
// Issue: Event listeners leak
// Fix: Remove in shutdown
shutdown(): void {
  this.events.off('some_event', this.handler, this);
  this.input.off('pointerdown', this.onClick, this);
}

// Issue: Tweens not destroyed
// Fix: Stop and destroy tweens
shutdown(): void {
  this.tweens.killAll();
}

// Issue: Sounds not destroyed
// Fix: Destroy sounds properly
shutdown(): void {
  if (this.music) {
    this.music.stop();
    this.music.destroy();
  }
}

// Issue: Graphics leak
// Fix: Clear and destroy
shutdown(): void {
  this.children.each((child) => {
    if (child instanceof Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics) {
      child.clear();
      child.destroy();
    }
  });
}
```

---

### 3. Audio Bugs

**Common Issues:**
- Audio not playing
- Volume too loud/quiet
- Audio not stopping
- Audio not looping correctly

**Typical Fixes:**
```typescript
// Issue: Audio not playing on mobile
// Fix: Unlock audio on first interaction
this.input.once('pointerdown', () => {
  this.audioManager.unlockAudio();
});

// Issue: Volume incorrect
// Fix: Apply correct volume calculation
const volume = this.config.masterVolume * this.config.sfxVolume;
this.sound.play(key, { volume });

// Issue: Music not looping
// Fix: Set loop property
this.sound.add(key, { loop: true });

// Issue: Overlapping music
// Fix: Stop current before playing new
if (this.currentMusic) {
  this.currentMusic.stop();
}
this.currentMusic = this.sound.add(key, { loop: true });
```

---

### 4. Scene Transition Bugs

**Common Issues:**
- Black screen during transition
- Scene not loading
- Data not passing between scenes
- Music not transitioning

**Typical Fixes:**
```typescript
// Issue: Data not passed
// Fix: Pass data object
this.scene.start('GameScene', { chapter: this.selectedChapter });

// Issue: Previous scene not cleaned up
// Fix: Implement shutdown()
shutdown(): void {
  // Clean up resources
  this.audioManager.stopMusic();
  this.events.removeAllListeners();
}

// Issue: Scene loading too long
// Fix: Preload in BootScene
preload(): void {
  this.load.image('all_assets');
  this.load.audio('all_audio');
}
```

---

### 5. Input Bugs

**Common Issues:**
- Input not responding
- Double-click issues
- Touch not working on mobile
- Input lag

**Typical Fixes:**
```typescript
// Issue: Input not responding
// Fix: Ensure interactive set
this.setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true });

// Issue: Double-click
// Fix: Add debouncing
private lastClickTime = 0;
onClick(): void {
  const now = this.scene.time.now;
  if (now - this.lastClickTime < 300) return; // 300ms debounce
  this.lastClickTime = now;
  // Handle click
}

// Issue: Touch not working
// Fix: Use 'pointerdown' instead of 'click'
this.on('pointerdown', this.onClick, this);

// Issue: Input lag
// Fix: Direct input, not tween
this.input.on('pointermove', (pointer) => {
  this.player.x = pointer.x;
});
```

---

### 6. Performance Bugs

**Common Issues:**
- FPS drops
- Memory leaks
- Slow collision detection
- Rendering bottleneck

**Typical Fixes:**
```typescript
// Issue: Too many draw calls
// Fix: Use texture atlas
this.load.atlas('sprites', 'sprites.png', 'sprites.json');

// Issue: Collision checking all objects
// Fix: Check only active objects
const active = this.zomboids.filter(z => z.active);
this.physics.overlap(projectiles, active, callback);

// Issue: Creating objects every frame
// Fix: Use object pool
class ProjectilePool {
  private pool: Projectile[] = [];

  get(): Projectile {
    return this.pool.pop() || new Projectile();
  }

  release(obj: Projectile): void {
    obj.reset();
    this.pool.push(obj);
  }
}

// Issue: Heavy update logic
// Fix: Throttle or cache calculations
private cachedValue: number;
private lastCalculation = 0;

update(time: number): void {
  if (time - this.lastCalculation > 100) { // Update every 100ms
    this.cachedValue = this.expensiveCalculation();
    this.lastCalculation = time;
  }
}
```

---

### 7. UI/Visual Bugs

**Common Issues:**
- Text rendering incorrectly
- Graphics not clearing
- Sprites not displaying
- Positioning issues

**Typical Fixes:**
```typescript
// Issue: Text cut off
// Fix: Set word wrap
this.add.text(x, y, text, {
  fontSize: '20px',
  wordWrap: { width: 400 }
});

// Issue: Graphics not clearing
// Fix: Clear before redrawing
draw(): void {
  this.graphics.clear();
  this.graphics.fillStyle(0xff0000);
  this.graphics.fillRect(x, y, w, h);
}

// Issue: Sprite not showing
// Fix: Ensure loaded and visible
if (!this.textures.exists('sprite_key')) {
  console.error('Texture not loaded');
}
this.sprite.setVisible(true);

// Issue: Positioning wrong on mobile
// Fix: Use scale manager
const centerX = this.scale.width / 2;
const centerY = this.scale.height / 2;
```

[Detailed description of the fix]

Fixes #[bug-id]"

# Example
git commit -m "fix: Collision detection not firing on destroyed objects (#15)

Added check to filter out destroyed zomboids before collision detection.
This prevents callbacks from firing on inactive objects.

Fixes #15"
```

### Branching Strategy (Optional)

```bash

## Notes
- Focus on P0 and P1 bugs first
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good (P2 bugs can wait)
- Document everything, even if not fixed
- Test thoroughly after each fix
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Keep CHANGELOG updated
- Every fix should be verified by a tester (or self-verify)
- When in doubt, fix it - bugs rarely fix themselves
- Be realistic about time - you may not fix everything

## Next Steps
After completion:
- **Release v1.0.0!**
- Monitor for post-launch issues
- Plan post-launch enhancements
- Consider Epic: Endless Mode
- Consider Epic: Additional Chapters
