# Zomboid Assault - Implementation Stories

Welcome to the implementation stories directory! This folder contains **sharded, actionable stories** extracted from the main implementation roadmap.

## 📚 What Are Stories?

Each story is a **self-contained unit of work** that:
- Has a clear goal and description
- Lists specific tasks with checkboxes
- Defines acceptance criteria
- Provides implementation code samples
- Includes testing instructions
- Shows dependencies on other stories

## 🎯 Why Shard Stories?

Breaking the roadmap into individual files makes development:
- **Easier to track** - Mark stories as complete individually
- **Better for teams** - Assign stories to different developers
- **More focused** - Work on one story at a time
- **Version controlled** - See history of each story's progress

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Solo Developers

1. **Read `STORY-INDEX.md`** to see all available stories
2. **Start with Phase 1**, Epic 1.1, Story 1.1.2 (Story 1.1.1 is already done!)
3. **Open the story file** and read the full description
4. **Follow the implementation guide** with code samples
5. **Check off tasks** as you complete them
6. **Run tests** to verify your work
7. **Mark story as complete** when all acceptance criteria met
8. **Move to next story** in sequence

### For Teams

1. **Assign stories** to team members based on expertise
2. **Check dependencies** - some stories must be done before others
3. **Use story status** to track who's working on what:
   - 🔴 BLOCKED - Cannot start yet
   - ⚪ TODO - Not started
   - 🟡 READY - All dependencies met
   - 🟢 IN PROGRESS - Currently being worked on
   - ✅ COMPLETED - Done!

## 🔧 Tools for Tracking Stories

### Option 1: Markdown Checkboxes
Edit story files directly and check off tasks as you complete them.

### Option 2: Git Branches
Create a branch for each story:
```bash
git checkout -b story/1.2.1-typescript-types
# Work on story
git commit -m "Complete Story 1.2.1"
git checkout main
git merge story/1.2.1-typescript-types
```

### Option 3: GitHub Issues/Projects
- Create an issue for each story
- Link to story file in description
- Use labels for status (ready, in-progress, completed)
- Track on project board

### Option 4: Todo List Tool
Use the BMad TodoWrite system:
```markdown
1. [in_progress] Story 1.2.1: Create TypeScript Type Definitions
2. [pending] Story 1.2.2: Implement ConfigLoader System
3. [pending] Story 1.3.1: Implement BootScene
```

## 🎓 Tips for Success

### 1. Work Sequentially
Stories have dependencies. Complete Phase 1 before Phase 2, etc.

### 2. Read Before Coding
Each story has implementation guidance - read it fully before starting.

### 3. Test Frequently
Run tests after each story to catch issues early.

### 4. Update Status
Mark stories complete as you finish them to track progress.

### 5. Ask Questions
If a story is unclear, check the reference docs:
- `docs/game-architecture.md`
- `docs/zomboid-assult-prototype-design.md`
- `public/config/` JSON files
