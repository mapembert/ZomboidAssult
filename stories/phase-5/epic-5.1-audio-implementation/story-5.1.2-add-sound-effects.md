  }
}
```

### CollisionManager.ts Integration

```typescript
import { AudioManager } from '@/systems/AudioManager';

export class CollisionManager {
  private audioManager: AudioManager;

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.audioManager = AudioManager.getInstance();
    this.audioManager.initialize(scene);
  }

  checkProjectileZomboidCollisions(projectiles: Projectile[], zomboids: Zomboid[]): void {
    projectiles.forEach((projectile) => {
      zomboids.forEach((zomboid) => {
        if (this.checkCollision(projectile, zomboid)) {
          // Play hit sound
          this.audioManager.playSFX('zomboid_hit', { volume: 0.3 });

          const destroyed = zomboid.takeDamage(projectile.getDamage());
          projectile.destroy();

          if (destroyed) {
            // Destroyed sound played via event in GameScene
            this.scene.events.emit('zomboid_destroyed', zomboid);
          }
        }
      });
    });
  }

  checkProjectileTimerCollisions(projectiles: Projectile[], timers: Timer[]): void {
    projectiles.forEach((projectile) => {
      timers.forEach((timer) => {
        if (this.checkCollision(projectile, timer)) {
          // Play timer increment sound
          this.scene.events.emit('timer_hit');

          timer.incrementCounter(1);
          projectile.destroy();
        }
      });
    });
  }
}
```

### WeaponSystem.ts Integration

```typescript
import { AudioManager } from '@/systems/AudioManager';

export class WeaponSystem {
  private audioManager: AudioManager;
  private lastFireSoundTime: number = 0;
  private fireSoundThrottle: number = 50; // ms, prevent overlap

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, weaponTypes: WeaponType[]) {
    // ... existing constructor ...

    this.audioManager = AudioManager.getInstance();
    this.audioManager.initialize(scene);
  }

  fire(x: number, y: number): void {
    // ... existing fire logic ...

    // Play projectile fire sound (throttled)
    const now = this.scene.time.now;
    if (now - this.lastFireSoundTime >= this.fireSoundThrottle) {
      this.audioManager.playSFX('projectile_fire', {
        volume: 0.2,
        detune: Phaser.Math.Between(-100, 100), // Pitch variation
      });
      this.lastFireSoundTime = now;
    }
  }

  upgradeWeapon(): void {
    // ... existing upgrade logic ...

    // Emit upgrade event (sound played in GameScene)
    this.scene.events.emit('weapon_upgraded');
  }
}
```

### HeroManager.ts Integration

```typescript
export class HeroManager {
  addHero(count: number): void {
    // ... existing add logic ...

    // Emit event for each hero added
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      this.scene.events.emit('hero_added');
    }
  }

  removeHero(count: number): void {
    // ... existing remove logic ...

    // Emit event for each hero removed
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      this.scene.events.emit('hero_removed');
    }
  }
}
```

### Volume Balancing Guide

**Relative Volume Levels (0.0 to 1.0):**
```typescript
const SFX_VOLUMES = {
  projectile_fire: 0.2,     // Very quiet (frequent)
  zomboid_hit: 0.3,         // Quiet (frequent)
  zomboid_destroyed: 0.5,   // Medium (common)
  timer_increment: 0.4,     // Medium-low (occasional)
  hero_add: 0.6,            // Medium-high (rare, important)
  hero_remove: 0.6,         // Medium-high (rare, important)
  weapon_upgrade: 0.7,      // High (very rare, celebrate!)
  wave_complete: 0.8,       // Very high (rare, important)
  game_over: 0.7,           // High (rare, finale)
};
```

**Balancing Strategy:**
1. **Frequency-based:** More frequent sounds = quieter
2. **Importance-based:** More important events = louder
3. **Overlap consideration:** Sounds that may overlap should be quieter

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [x] Projectile fire plays on weapon fire
- [x] Zomboid hit plays on projectile collision
- [x] Zomboid destroyed plays when health reaches 0
- [x] Timer increment plays when timer hit
- [x] Hero add plays when heroes added
- [x] Hero remove plays when heroes removed
- [x] Weapon upgrade plays on weapon tier increase
- [x] Wave complete plays on wave end
- [x] Game over plays when game ends

### Volume Testing
- [x] No SFX too loud (check wave complete, weapon upgrade)
- [x] Projectile fire not overwhelming during rapid fire
- [x] All SFX audible but not jarring
- [x] Balance between SFX and music maintained

### Technical Testing
- [x] No audio lag (< 50ms)
- [x] Rapid fire doesn't cause stuttering
- [x] Multiple zomboid deaths handled smoothly
- [x] SFX respects volume slider
- [x] Mute button silences all SFX
- [x] SFX works on iOS Safari
- [x] SFX works on Android Chrome

### Edge Case Testing
- [x] Max weapon tier (mega_machine_gun) rapid fire
- [x] 10+ zomboids destroyed simultaneously
- [x] Timer hit during weapon fire
- [x] Hero add/remove during destruction sounds
- [x] Wave complete while SFX playing

## Performance Considerations

### Throttling Frequent SFX
```typescript
// Example: Limit projectile fire sound to once per 50ms
if (now - this.lastFireSoundTime >= 50) {
  this.audioManager.playSFX('projectile_fire');
  this.lastFireSoundTime = now;
}
```

### Limiting Simultaneous Sounds
Phaser automatically limits concurrent sounds, but keep it reasonable:
- Max ~5-10 simultaneous SFX
- Prioritize important sounds (hero add > zomboid hit)

### Audio File Optimization
- Use MP3 at 128 kbps (good quality, small file)
- Keep SFX files < 50 KB each
- Trim silence from start/end of audio files

## Success Metrics
- âœ… All 9 SFX implemented and working
- âœ… Audio lag < 50ms from trigger to playback
- âœ… Volume balanced across all SFX
- âœ… No stuttering or clipping
- âœ… Works reliably on desktop and mobile
- âœ… Enhances gameplay experience

## Next Steps
After completion:
- Story 5.1.3: Add Background Music

## Notes
- Start with placeholder/generated sounds from bfxr
- Can polish/replace sounds later based on feedback
- Consider pitch variation for repeated sounds (projectile fire)
- May want to add sound toggle per-category in settings
- Test with headphones and speakers
- Volume balancing is subjective - iterate based on playtesting
