- [ ] Implement music playback in GameOverScene/ChapterCompleteScene
- [ ] Add smooth fade transitions between scenes
- [ ] Test music looping (no gaps or clicks)
- [ ] Balance music volume with SFX
- [ ] Test on desktop and mobile

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 3 music tracks created and loaded
- [ ] Menu music plays on MenuScene start
- [ ] Game music plays on GameScene start
- [ ] GameOver music plays on GameOverScene start
- [ ] Music loops seamlessly without gaps
- [ ] Fade transitions between scenes (1-2 seconds)

### Scene Integration

#### MenuScene.ts
```typescript
import { AudioManager } from '@/systems/AudioManager';

export class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create(): void {
    // ... existing scene setup ...

    // Initialize and play menu music
    const audioManager = AudioManager.getInstance();
    audioManager.initialize(this);
    audioManager.playMusic('menu_music', 1500); // 1.5s fade in

    // Unlock audio on first interaction (mobile)
    this.input.once('pointerdown', () => {
      audioManager.unlockAudio();
    });
  }

  shutdown(): void {
    // Don't stop music here - let target scene handle transition
  }
}
```

#### GameScene.ts
```typescript
import { AudioManager } from '@/systems/AudioManager';

export class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create(): void {
    // ... existing scene setup ...

    // Transition from menu music to game music
    const audioManager = AudioManager.getInstance();
    audioManager.initialize(this);

    // Stop menu music with fade, then start game music
    audioManager.stopMusic(500); // 0.5s fade out

    // Start game music after menu music fades (handled in AudioManager)
    this.time.delayedCall(600, () => {
      audioManager.playMusic('game_music', 1000); // 1s fade in
    });
  }

  shutdown(): void {
    // Music will be stopped by next scene
  }
}
```

#### GameOverScene.ts
```typescript
import { AudioManager } from '@/systems/AudioManager';

export class GameOverScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create(): void {
    // ... existing scene setup ...

    // Transition to game over music
    const audioManager = AudioManager.getInstance();
    audioManager.initialize(this);

    // Stop game music, start game over music
    audioManager.stopMusic(800); // 0.8s fade out

    this.time.delayedCall(900, () => {
      audioManager.playMusic('gameover_music', 1200); // 1.2s fade in
    });
  }
}
```

#### ChapterCompleteScene.ts (Optional - Victory Music)
```typescript
import { AudioManager } from '@/systems/AudioManager';

export class ChapterCompleteScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  create(): void {
    // ... existing scene setup ...

    const audioManager = AudioManager.getInstance();
    audioManager.initialize(this);

    // Option 1: Play wave_complete SFX (already implemented)
    audioManager.playSFX('wave_complete', { volume: 0.8 });

    // Option 2: Play menu music (celebratory but calm)
    audioManager.stopMusic(500);
    this.time.delayedCall(600, () => {
      audioManager.playMusic('menu_music', 1000);
    });
  }
}
```

### Seamless Looping

To ensure music loops without gaps:

1. **Audio File Preparation:**
   - Trim silence from start and end
   - Ensure loop point matches musically
   - Export with no trailing silence
   - Test in audio editor first

2. **Phaser Configuration:**
```typescript
// In AudioManager.playMusic()
this.currentMusic = this.scene.sound.add(key, {
  loop: true,  // Enable looping
  volume: 0,
});
```

3. **Loop Point Testing:**
   - Play music for 5+ minutes
   - Listen for clicks or gaps at loop point
   - Adjust audio file if issues detected

### Music Transition Matrix

| From Scene | To Scene | Transition |
|------------|----------|------------|
| MenuScene | GameScene | Fade out 500ms â†’ Fade in 1000ms |
| GameScene | GameOverScene | Fade out 800ms â†’ Fade in 1200ms |
| GameScene | ChapterCompleteScene | Fade out 500ms â†’ Fade in 1000ms |
| GameOverScene | MenuScene | Fade out 500ms â†’ Fade in 1000ms |
| ChapterCompleteScene | MenuScene | Fade out 500ms â†’ Fade in 1000ms |
| ChapterCompleteScene | GameScene (next) | Continue game music or brief pause |

- **Garage Band** (Mac, free) - User-friendly music creation
- **Ableton Live** (paid) - Professional DAW
- **FL Studio** (paid) - Popular for electronic music

**Approach:**

2. Add bassline (synth or sub-bass)
3. Layer synth pads for atmosphere
4. Add hi-hats and percussion
5. Keep it minimal (4-6 tracks maximum)
6. Ensure musical loop point (4, 8, or 16 bars)
7. Export as MP3 (128-192 kbps)

### Audio File Specifications

**Format:** MP3
**Bitrate:** 128-192 kbps
**Sample Rate:** 44.1 kHz
**Channels:** Stereo
**File Size Target:** < 2 MB per track

## Volume Balancing with SFX

Music should be quieter than SFX to avoid masking important audio cues:

```typescript
// Default volumes (in game-settings.json and AudioManager)
{
  "masterVolume": 0.7,
  "musicVolume": 0.5,   // Music quieter than SFX
  "sfxVolume": 0.8
}

// Effective volumes:
// Music: 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.35 (35% of max)
// SFX: 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56 (56% of max)
```

**Testing:**
- Play game with both music and SFX
- Ensure important SFX (zomboid destroyed, weapon upgrade) clearly audible over music
- Music should provide atmosphere without dominating

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Menu music plays on MenuScene start
- [ ] Menu music loops seamlessly (listen for 5+ minutes)
- [ ] Game music plays on GameScene start
- [ ] Game music loops seamlessly
- [ ] GameOver music plays on GameOverScene
- [ ] Music transitions smooth between scenes
- [ ] No music overlap (old stops before new starts)
- [ ] Mute button silences music
- [ ] Music volume slider works
- [ ] Music restarts correctly after unmute

### Quality Testing
- [ ] No gaps or clicks at loop points
- [ ] No audio artifacts (pops, distortion)
- [ ] Music volume balanced with SFX
- [ ] All SFX audible over music
- [ ] Music fits the game atmosphere
- [ ] Tempo feels appropriate for gameplay

### Platform Testing
- [ ] Desktop Chrome: Music plays and loops
- [ ] Desktop Firefox: Music plays and loops
- [ ] Desktop Safari: Music plays and loops
- [ ] Mobile iOS Safari: Music works after unlock
- [ ] Mobile Android Chrome: Music works
- [ ] No lag on mobile devices

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Rapid scene transitions (music handles gracefully)
- [ ] Pause/unpause during music playback
- [ ] Volume change during music playback
- [ ] Mute/unmute during fade transition
- [ ] Browser tab hidden/shown (music continues)

## Performance Considerations

- Music files should be < 2 MB each (total ~6 MB for 3 tracks)
- Use streaming for music (Phaser handles this automatically)
- Don't preload all music (load in BootScene is fine)
- Monitor memory usage (music shouldn't cause leaks)

## Success Metrics
- âœ… All 3 music tracks implemented
- âœ… Seamless looping with no gaps
- âœ… Smooth scene transitions
- âœ… Volume balanced with SFX
- âœ… Works on desktop and mobile
- âœ… Enhances game atmosphere

## Next Steps
After completion:
- Epic 5.2: Performance Optimization
- Story 5.2.1: Profile and Optimize Rendering

## Notes
- Music selection is subjective - iterate based on feedback
- Can replace music tracks easily later
- Consider offering multiple music options in settings (future)
- Dark mode aesthetic: minimal, electronic, atmospheric
- Music should never feel intrusive or distracting
- Test with different music volume levels (some players prefer lower music)
- Consider adding music credits in game menu
