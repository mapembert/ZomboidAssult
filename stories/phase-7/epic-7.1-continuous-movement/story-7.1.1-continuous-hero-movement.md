# Story: Implement 12-Column Hero Movement System

**Epic:** Epic 7.1 - Smooth Hero Movement System
**Story ID:** 7.1.1
**Priority:** High
**Points:** 5
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Description

Replace the current discrete 2-column hero movement system with a 12-column discrete positioning system that provides smooth visual movement between positions. Heroes should be able to move to any of 12 evenly-spaced column positions across the screen with smooth interpolation, velocity-based physics, and proper boundary constraints. This provides the appearance of continuous movement while maintaining discrete positions that aid in alignment with zomboids for better targeting.

Currently, heroes snap between two fixed column positions (x = screenWidth/4 and x = 3*screenWidth/4). This story implements movement across 12 discrete columns (positions 0-11) with smooth interpolation between them, configurable movement speed, acceleration curves, and boundary padding. The visual result appears nearly continuous, but the actual positions are quantized to aid gameplay alignment.

### Key Implementation Details

**Hero.ts Changes:**
```typescript
private targetColumnIndex: number; // 0-11, replaces old 2-column system
private currentX: number; // Smoothly interpolated visual position
setTargetColumn(columnIndex: number): void
getTargetColumn(): number
```

**HeroManager.ts Changes:**
```typescript
// 12-column discrete positioning system
private readonly COLUMN_COUNT = 12;
private targetColumnIndex: number; // Discrete column (0-11)
private currentX: number; // Smoothly interpolated X position
private velocityX: number; // For smooth transitions
private columnPositions: number[]; // Pre-calculated X positions for each column

// Calculate evenly-spaced column positions
private calculateColumnPositions(): void // Creates 12 positions across screen width
private getColumnX(columnIndex: number): number // Maps column index to X pixel position
setTargetColumn(columnIndex: number): void // Snaps to column 0-11
getTargetColumn(): number // Returns current target column
update(delta: number): void // Smooth interpolation between columns with accel/decel
```

**Column Position Calculation:**
```typescript
// 12 evenly-spaced columns across playable width
const playableWidth = screenWidth - (2 * boundaryPadding);
const columnSpacing = playableWidth / (COLUMN_COUNT - 1);
columnPositions[i] = boundaryPadding + (i * columnSpacing);
// Results in columns at: 60px, 120px, 180px, ... 660px (for 720px screen)
```

**Physics Implementation:**
- Smooth interpolation between discrete column positions
- Acceleration/deceleration curves using `v² / 2a` stopping distance
- Frame-rate independent using delta time
- Column index clamping (0-11) prevents invalid positions
- Visual X position updates every frame for smooth appearance

**GameScene.ts Implementation:**
Keyboard movement increments/decrements target column index:
```typescript
const currentColumn = heroManager.getTargetColumn();

if (left key held) {
  heroManager.setTargetColumn(currentColumn - 1); // Clamps to 0
} else if (right key held) {
  heroManager.setTargetColumn(currentColumn + 1); // Clamps to 11
}
// Heroes smoothly animate to target column position
```

This provides smooth movement between 12 discrete positions, combining the visual appeal of continuous movement with the tactical benefits of discrete positioning for better alignment with zomboids.

## Completion Notes

**12-Column Discrete System:**
The implementation uses 12 evenly-spaced discrete column positions (0-11) instead of true continuous movement. This provides the visual appearance of smooth continuous movement through interpolation, while maintaining discrete positions that significantly improve alignment between heroes and zomboids for better targeting accuracy.

**Key Achievements:**
1. Refactored from 2-column to 12-column discrete positioning system
2. Implemented smooth interpolation between columns for visual continuity
3. Added velocity-based physics for natural acceleration/deceleration
4. Configured all parameters in JSON files for easy tuning
5. Maintained 60 FPS with no performance regressions
6. Pre-calculated column positions for optimal performance
7. Provided tactical positioning benefits through discrete alignment points

**Design Rationale:**
The 12-column approach balances visual smoothness with gameplay precision. Players get the responsive feel of continuous movement while benefiting from automatic alignment to positions that correspond with zomboid columns, improving targeting effectiveness.

**Next Steps:**
- Story 7.1.2: Update drag/touch input to snap to nearest of 12 columns
- Story 7.1.3: Update weapon targeting to work with column-based positioning
- Story 7.3.1: Balance movement parameters based on gameplay testing
