# Story: Update Collision Detection for Continuous Positions

**Epic:** Epic 7.2 - Random Zomboid Spawning System
**Story ID:** 7.2.2
**Priority:** High
**Points:** 3
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ READY TO START

## Description

Verify and optimize collision detection for the new continuous positioning system. With heroes and zomboids now able to be at any X position (not just fixed columns), we need to ensure collision detection remains accurate and performant across the full screen width. This story focuses on testing, validation, and optimization rather than major refactoring.

The current collision system uses circular/rectangular bounding box collision detection which should work with continuous positions, but needs verification and potential optimization for the increased position variety.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Projectile-zomboid collisions detect accurately at any X position
- [ ] Projectile-timer collisions detect accurately at any X position
- [ ] Collision detection works correctly across full screen width (60px to 660px)
- [ ] No collision detection gaps or dead zones
- [ ] Multiple projectiles can hit the same zomboid (multi-hit still works)
- [ ] Collision response is consistent regardless of position
- [ ] Edge case collisions work (zomboids at screen boundaries)

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Code follows TypeScript strict mode standards
- [ ] Maintains 60 FPS with continuous collision detection

- [ ] No memory leaks or performance degradation over time
- [ ] Collision math handles floating-point positions correctly

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Collision detection completes in < 2ms per frame (target)
- [ ] Performance scales linearly with entity count
- [ ] No stuttering during high-entity scenarios (50+ zomboids, 100+ projectiles)
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during gameplay
- [ ] CPU usage does not spike during collision checks

### Game Design Requirements

- [ ] Hit detection feels fair and responsive
- [ ] No phantom hits or misses due to positioning
- [ ] Collision feedback is immediate and consistent
- [ ] Game difficulty is maintained with continuous collisions

## Technical Specifications

### Files to Create/Modify

**New Files:**

- None (optimization of existing system)

**Modified Files:**

- `src/systems/CollisionManager.ts` - Verify collision detection logic, add optimizations if needed

### Current Collision Detection Logic

The CollisionManager currently implements:

```typescript
class CollisionManager {
  /**
   * Check circular collision between two entities
   */
  private checkCircleCollision(
    x1: number, y1: number, r1: number,
    x2: number, y2: number, r2: number
  ): boolean {
    const dx = x2 - x1;
    const dy = y2 - y1;
    const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    return distance < (r1 + r2);
  }

  /**
   * Process collisions between projectiles and zomboids
   */
  processCollisions(
    projectiles: Projectile[],
    zomboids: Zomboid[]
  ): void {
    // Current implementation loops through all projectiles
    // and checks against all zomboids (O(n*m) complexity)
  }
}
```

### Optimization Strategies

**If Performance Issues Detected:**

1. **Spatial Partitioning (Quadtree)**
```typescript
class CollisionManager {
  private quadtree: Phaser.Structs.QuadTree;

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, bounds: Phaser.Geom.Rectangle) {
    this.quadtree = new Phaser.Structs.QuadTree(bounds, 10, 4);
  }

  processCollisions(projectiles: Projectile[], zomboids: Zomboid[]): void {
    // Clear and rebuild quadtree each frame
    this.quadtree.clear();

    // Insert zomboids into quadtree
    zomboids.forEach(z => this.quadtree.insert(z.getBounds()));

    // Query quadtree for each projectile
    projectiles.forEach(p => {
      const nearby = this.quadtree.retrieve(p.getBounds());
      // Only check collisions with nearby entities
    });
  }
}
```

2. **Grid-Based Culling**
```typescript
class CollisionManager {
  private gridCellSize: number = 100; // pixels

  private getGridCell(x: number, y: number): string {
    const col = Math.floor(x / this.gridCellSize);
    const row = Math.floor(y / this.gridCellSize);
    return `${col},${row}`;
  }

  processCollisions(projectiles: Projectile[], zomboids: Zomboid[]): void {
    // Group zomboids by grid cell
    const zomboidGrid = new Map<string, Zomboid[]>();
    zomboids.forEach(z => {
      const cell = this.getGridCell(z.x, z.y);
      if (!zomboidGrid.has(cell)) zomboidGrid.set(cell, []);
      zomboidGrid.get(cell)!.push(z);
    });

    // Check projectiles only against zomboids in same/adjacent cells
    projectiles.forEach(p => {
      const cell = this.getGridCell(p.x, p.y);
      const nearbyZomboids = this.getNearbyZomboids(cell, zomboidGrid);
      // Check collisions with nearby zomboids only
    });
  }
}
```

3. **Early Exit Optimization**
```typescript
processCollisions(projectiles: Projectile[], zomboids: Zomboid[]): void {
  // Filter out inactive/destroyed entities first
  const activeProjectiles = projectiles.filter(p => p.active);
  const activeZomboids = zomboids.filter(z => z.active && z.health > 0);

  // Sort by Y position for potential early exit
  activeZomboids.sort((a, b) => a.y - b.y);

  for (const projectile of activeProjectiles) {
    if (!projectile.active) continue; // Skip if already hit something

    for (const zomboid of activeZomboids) {
      // Early exit if zomboid is too far below projectile
      if (zomboid.y > projectile.y + 100) break;

      if (this.checkCollision(projectile, zomboid)) {
        this.handleCollision(projectile, zomboid);
        if (!projectile.active) break; // Projectile destroyed, no need to check more
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes

**Implementation Notes:**

- Current collision system likely works fine with continuous positions
- Main focus is verification and optimization, not major refactoring
- Use browser DevTools Performance tab for profiling
- Consider adding debug visualization for collision bounds during testing
- Phaser has built-in `Phaser.Geom.Intersects` utilities for various shapes
- QuadTree implementation available in Phaser: `Phaser.Structs.QuadTree`

**Design Decisions:**

- **Verify before optimize**: Test current system first, only optimize if needed
- **Spatial partitioning threshold**: Only implement if collision time > 2ms
- **Maintain current collision math**: Circular/rectangular collision is proven and simple
- **No physics engine**: Continue using custom collision (Phaser Physics would be overkill)

**Optimization Decision Tree:**

1. Test current system performance
2. If < 2ms: No optimization needed, mark complete
3. If 2-5ms: Implement early exit optimization or grid culling
4. If > 5ms: Implement full quadtree spatial partitioning
5. Re-test and verify improvement

**Future Considerations:**

- Could add collision pooling to reduce GC pressure
- Could add collision prediction for fast-moving projectiles
- Could implement broad-phase/narrow-phase collision pipeline
- Story 7.3.1 may adjust entity counts based on performance limits

**Testing Tools:**

- Use `console.time('collisions')` and `console.timeEnd('collisions')` for quick profiling
- Chrome DevTools Performance profiler for detailed analysis
- Phaser's built-in FPS meter for frame-rate monitoring
- Consider adding `/debug collision` command to visualize collision bounds

**Performance Baseline:**

Before making changes, establish baseline metrics:
- Collision time per frame in column-based system
- Frame rate stability in column-based system
- Memory usage in column-based system
- Use these as comparison points for continuous system
