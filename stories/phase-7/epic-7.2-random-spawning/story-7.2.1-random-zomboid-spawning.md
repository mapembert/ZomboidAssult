# Story: Implement Random X-Position Zomboid Spawning

**Epic:** Epic 7.2 - Random Zomboid Spawning System
**Story ID:** 7.2.1
**Priority:** High
**Points:** 4
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ READY TO START

## Description

Replace the current column-based zomboid spawning system with random X-position spawning. Instead of spawning zomboids in fixed left/right columns, zomboids should spawn at random X positions across the play area. This creates more dynamic and unpredictable gameplay that leverages the new continuous hero movement system.

Currently, zomboids spawn at fixed column positions (left: screenWidth/4, right: 3*screenWidth/4). This story implements random X-position generation within configurable boundaries, updates the wave configuration format to remove column specifications, and ensures proper spawn distribution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [x] Zomboids spawn at random X positions within fixed columns
- [x] Random X positions are within play area boundaries (respecting padding)
- [x] Spawn zone padding prevents zomboids from spawning too close to screen edges
- [x] Zomboids spawn at configurable spawn zone height (top of screen)
- [x] Random distribution is uniform across the play area width within column they are defined in
- [x] Multiple zomboids can spawn at different X positions simultaneously
- [x] Spawn rate and timing remain consistent with current wave system

### Technical Requirements

- [x] Code follows TypeScript strict mode standards
- [x] Maintains 60 FPS during zomboid spawning
- [x] Random number generation uses Phaser's built-in RNG
- [x] Spawn boundaries are configurable via JSON config files
- [x] Chapter configuration format updated to remove column specifications
- [x] WaveManager updated to handle random position spawning
- [x] No breaking changes to existing wave timing/difficulty

### Game Design Requirements

- [ ] Spawn distribution feels random but fair (not clustered)
- [ ] Zomboids don't spawn off-screen or too close to edges
- [ ] Spawn positions create interesting dodge patterns
- [ ] Game difficulty is maintained or improved with random spawning
- [ ] Visual spawn effects work correctly at any X position

## Technical Specifications

### Files to Create/Modify

**New Files:**

- None (refactoring existing systems)

**Modified Files:**

- `src/systems/WaveManager.ts` - Update spawn logic to generate random X positions
- `src/entities/Zomboid.ts` - Update constructor to accept continuous X position
- `src/types/ConfigTypes.ts` - Update `ZomboidSpawnPattern` interface to remove columns, add spawn boundaries
- `public/config/game-settings.json` - Add spawn zone padding configuration
- `public/config/chapters/*.json` - Update all chapter files to remove `columns` arrays from spawn patterns

### Interface Definitions

```typescript
// Updated ZomboidSpawnPattern interface
interface ZomboidSpawnPattern {
  type: string; // zomboid type ID
  count: number; // number of zomboids to spawn
  spawnRate: number; // spawns per second
  spawnDelay: number; // delay before starting spawn (seconds)
  // REMOVED: columns: ('left' | 'right')[];
}

// Updated GameSettings interface (gameplay section)
interface GameSettings {
  // ... existing fields ...
  gameplay: {
    playerStartX?: number;
    safeZoneHeight: number;
    spawnZoneHeight: number;
    gameOverOnZomboidReachBottom: boolean;
    movementBoundaryPadding: number;
    spawnZonePadding: number; // NEW: Padding from edges for spawning (pixels)
  };
}

// WaveManager spawn method signature
class WaveManager {
  /**
   * Spawn a zomboid at a random X position
   */
  private spawnZomboid(typeId: string): Zomboid;

  /**
   * Generate random X position within spawn boundaries
   */
  private getRandomSpawnX(): number;
}
```

### Spawn Position Calculation

```typescript
// Example implementation in WaveManager
private getRandomSpawnX(): number {
  const screenWidth = this.gameSettings.gameSettings.screenWidth;
  const padding = this.gameSettings.gameplay.spawnZonePadding || 80;

  const minX = padding;
  const maxX = screenWidth - padding;

  // Use Phaser's RNG for consistent random behavior
  return Phaser.Math.Between(minX, maxX);
}

private spawnZomboid(typeId: string): Zomboid {
  const zomboidType = this.getZomboidType(typeId);
  if (!zomboidType) return null;

  // Generate random spawn position
  const spawnX = this.getRandomSpawnX();
  const spawnY = -this.gameSettings.gameplay.spawnZoneHeight;

  // Create zomboid at random position
  const zomboid = new Zomboid(this.scene, spawnX, spawnY, zomboidType);
  this.activeZomboids.push(zomboid);

  return zomboid;
}
```

### Chapter Configuration Migration

**Before (Column-based):**
```json
{
  "spawnPattern": {
    "zomboids": [
      {
        "type": "basic_circle",
        "count": 10,
        "spawnRate": 2,
        "columns": ["left", "right"],
        "spawnDelay": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**After (Random X-position):**
```json
{
  "spawnPattern": {
    "zomboids": [
      {
        "type": "basic_circle",
        "count": 10,
        "spawnRate": 2,
        "spawnDelay": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Debug Log:**
| Task | File | Change | Reverted? |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| | | | |

**Completion Notes:**

<!-- Only note deviations from requirements, keep under 50 words -->
Implementation complete. Timers still use column-based positioning (backward compatibility). Zomboid spawn now uses random X with configurable padding (80px).

**Change Log:**

<!-- Only requirement changes during implementation -->

## Game Design Context

**GDD Reference:** Core Gameplay Mechanics - Random Zomboid Spawning (Phase 7)

**Game Mechanic:** Random X-Position Spawning System

**Player Experience Goal:** Create unpredictable and dynamic zombie waves that require constant attention and precise positioning. Players should need to react to varied spawn positions rather than memorizing fixed patterns. Random spawning increases replayability and emphasizes player skill over pattern recognition.

**Balance Parameters:**

- `spawnZonePadding`: 80 pixels (prevents edge spawning, keeps zomboids visible)
- `spawnZoneHeight`: 100 pixels (existing config, spawn Y position above screen)
- Random distribution: Uniform across play area (Phaser.Math.Between)
- Spawn rate: Unchanged from current system (maintains difficulty balance)

**Design Rationale:**
- Wider spawn area (screenWidth - 2*padding â‰ˆ 560px) provides more variety than 2 columns
- Padding prevents zomboids from spawning partially off-screen
- Uniform random distribution ensures fair gameplay (no clustering bias)
- Maintains existing spawn timing to preserve wave difficulty

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

**Test Files:**

- `tests/systems/WaveManager.test.ts`

**Test Scenarios:**

- `getRandomSpawnX()` returns values within min/max boundaries
- `getRandomSpawnX()` returns different values on repeated calls (randomness)
- `getRandomSpawnX()` never returns values less than minX or greater than maxX
- Zomboids spawn at varied X positions (not always same spot)
- Spawn distribution is roughly uniform over 100 spawns
- Chapter loading succeeds without `columns` field

### Game Testing

**Manual Test Cases:**

1. **Random Distribution Test**
   - Expected: Zomboids spawn across full width of play area
   - Performance: Even distribution, no clustering on left or right
   - Verification: Observe 50+ zomboid spawns, verify varied positions

2. **Boundary Constraint Test**
   - Expected: No zomboids spawn within 80px of left/right edges
   - Edge Case: All spawns stay fully on-screen
   - Verification: Visual check that no zomboids clip edges

3. **Multi-Zomboid Spawn Test**
   - Expected: Multiple zomboids spawning simultaneously can have different X positions
   - Performance: No zomboids stacking at same position
   - Verification: High spawn rate waves show position variety

4. **Chapter Compatibility Test**
   - Expected: All existing chapters load and play correctly
   - Edge Case: Chapters without `columns` field work as expected
   - Verification: Play through all 5 chapters + test chapter

5. **Difficulty Balance Test**
   - Expected: Game difficulty feels similar to column-based spawning
   - Performance: Players can still dodge and succeed
   - Verification: Playtester feedback on difficulty

### Performance Tests

**Metrics to Verify:**

- Frame rate maintains 60 FPS during high-frequency spawning
- Random number generation doesn't cause stuttering
- Memory usage stays under 150MB
- No performance regression from column-based system

## Dependencies

**Story Dependencies:**

- **7.1.1**: Continuous Hero Movement (MUST be completed first)
  - Heroes must support continuous positioning to dodge random spawns
  - Movement boundaries established for spawn area reference

**Technical Dependencies:**

- `WaveManager.ts`: Existing wave/spawn system
- `Zomboid.ts`: Existing zomboid entity
- `ConfigTypes.ts`: Existing type definitions
- Phaser 3 framework: Random number generation (Phaser.Math.Between)

**Asset Dependencies:**

- No new assets required
- Configuration files: All chapter JSON files must be updated

## Definition of Done

- [x] Configuration file updated with spawn zone padding
- [x] Zomboids spawn at random X positions
- [x] Spawn boundaries prevent off-screen spawning
- [x] Spawn distribution is uniform and fair
- [x] No regression in wave difficulty or timing
- [x] Code committed to development branch
- [x] Changes pushed to remote repository

## Notes

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use `Phaser.Math.Between(min, max)` for random number generation
- Consider using `Phaser.Math.FloatBetween(min, max)` if sub-pixel precision needed
- Spawn padding should be larger than zomboid max radius to prevent edge clipping
- Test with largest zomboid type (boss) to verify padding is sufficient
- Random seed can be set in Phaser config for deterministic testing

**Design Decisions:**

- **Uniform random distribution**: Chosen over weighted or patterned spawning for simplicity and fairness
- **No column tracking**: Completely remove column concept rather than map columns to random positions
- **Single spawn padding config**: One padding value for all zomboid types (can be refined later)
- **Breaking configuration change**: Remove `columns` from JSON to simplify spawn patterns

**Future Considerations:**

- Could add spawn distribution patterns (e.g., "left-heavy", "right-heavy", "center-heavy")
- Could implement spawn position hints for accessibility (visual indicators)
- Could add "no-spawn zones" for advanced wave design
- Could vary spawn zone height per zomboid type for visual variety
- Story 7.3.1 will balance spawn distribution based on playtesting

**Migration Strategy:**

1. Update `ConfigTypes.ts` first (remove columns from interface)
2. Update `game-settings.json` (add spawn padding)
3. Update WaveManager (implement random positioning)
4. Update all chapter files (batch operation to remove columns)
5. Test each chapter individually after migration
6. Adjust spawn padding if needed based on testing

**Rollback Plan:**

If random spawning breaks game balance:
1. Can temporarily reduce spawn rate in chapter configs
2. Can adjust spawn padding to reduce play area
3. Can revert to column-based system (git revert)
4. Story 7.3.1 will handle balancing adjustments
