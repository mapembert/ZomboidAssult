# Phase 7: Continuous Movement System

**Duration:** Days 14-16 (Estimated 24 hours total)
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ READY TO START

## Overview
Phase 7 transforms the gameplay from discrete 2-column movement to a continuous movement system. Heroes will be able to slide freely along the X-axis, and zomboids will spawn at random horizontal positions, creating more dynamic and engaging gameplay that requires precise positioning and timing.

## Prerequisites
- âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- âœ… Phase 2: Core Gameplay Mechanics (Completed)
- âœ… Phase 3: Timer Mechanic and Weapon Upgrades (Completed)
- âœ… Phase 4: Wave Progression and Content (Completed)
- âœ… Phase 5: Audio and Polish (Completed)

## Phase Objectives
1. **Continuous Hero Movement** - Replace discrete column movement with smooth X-axis sliding
2. **Touch/Drag Input** - Implement drag-to-move controls for mobile with keyboard smoothing for desktop
3. **Random Zomboid Spawning** - Spawn zomboids at random X positions instead of fixed columns
4. **Updated Collision System** - Adjust collision detection for continuous positioning
5. **Maintain 60 FPS Performance** - Ensure smooth performance with new movement system
