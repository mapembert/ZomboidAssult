## üéØ Recent Session Accomplishments

### 1. **Created 8-Chapter Progressive Campaign** (Oct 31, 2025)
Expanded the game from 3 chapters to a full 8-chapter progressive adventure with balanced difficulty curve.

**Chapters Created/Modified**:
- ‚úÖ Chapter 1: "First Contact" - Tutorial (kept mostly as-is, well balanced)
- ‚úÖ Chapter 2: "One-Side Pressure" - Introduces tactical side-based spawning
- ‚úÖ Chapter 3: "Speed Demons" - Fast enemies (square/hex types) - **REBALANCED**
- ‚úÖ Chapter 4: "Heavy Defense" - Large zomboids - **REBALANCED**
- ‚úÖ Chapter 5: "Mixed Assault" - All non-boss enemy types, introduces tier 6 sniper
- ‚úÖ Chapter 6: "First Boss" - Introduces boss_circle_tank (150 HP)
- ‚úÖ Chapter 7: "Ultimate Challenge" - All 3 boss types
- ‚úÖ Chapter 8: "Test Playground" - Chaos mode with tier 7 ultimate weapon

**Files Modified**:
- `public/config/chapters/chapter-03.json` - Reduced spawn rates and counts
- `public/config/chapters/chapter-04.json` - Major rebalancing to fix spawn pressure
- `public/config/chapters/chapter-05.json` - NEW
- `public/config/chapters/chapter-06.json` - NEW
- `public/config/chapters/chapter-07.json` - NEW
- `public/config/chapters/chapter-08.json` - NEW

### 2. **Fixed Critical Weapon Balance Issue**
**Problem**: Sniper Rifle (tier 6) had only 2.5 DPS, making chapters 5-8 nearly impossible.

**Fix**:
```json
// public/config/entities/weapons.json
{
  "id": "sniper_rifle",
  "fireRate": 0.15,  // Was: 0.8 (too slow!)
  "damage": 2,
  "penetrationDamage": 15
}
```
- **Old DPS**: 2.5 (worse than tier 1!)
- **New DPS**: 13.3 (balanced for boss encounters)

### 3. **Created Python Balance Analyzer Script**
Built a comprehensive tool to analyze chapter difficulty: `analyze_balance.py`

**Features**:
- Calculates total enemy HP per wave
- Estimates player damage output based on weapons and timing
- **Accounts for timer catch mechanics** (time NOT shooting enemies)
- **Detects spawn pressure** (when enemy spawn rate > player DPS)
- Grades each wave (A+ to F scale)
- Identifies problem waves

**Key Insights Discovered**:
- Chapter 3 Wave 1: 4.4 HP/sec spawning vs 2.0 DPS (SHORT 2.4 HP/sec)
- Chapter 4 Wave 1: 11.0 HP/sec spawning vs 2.0 DPS (SHORT 9.0 HP/sec!)
- Chapters 5-8 were impossible before sniper fix

**Run Command**: `python analyze_balance.py`

### 4. **Updated Chapter Registration System**
Modified game to recognize all 8 chapters:

**Files Updated**:
- `src/systems/ConfigLoader.ts` - Added chapters 04-08 to `getAllChapters()`
- `src/scenes/MenuScene.ts` - Added chapters 04-08 to `getAvailableChapters()`

### 5. **Fixed Two Critical Bugs** (Most Recent)

#### Bug #1: Game Over Sound Looping
- **Problem**: Losing sound played continuously in a loop
- **Fix**: Added `loop: false` to game over SFX call
- **File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.ts:732`

#### Bug #2: Wave Complete Screen Persisting
- **Problem**: "Wave Complete" overlay stayed visible during next wave, blocking view
- **Fix**:
  - Destroy existing overlay before creating new one
  - Set `waveCompleteOverlay = null` after fadeOut
  - Added cleanup to `shutdown()` method
- **File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.ts:760-764, 773, 879-882`

## üéÆ Game Mechanics Summary

### Weapon Tiers (DPS)
1. **Single Gun** (Tier 1): 2.0 DPS - Starting weapon
2. **Double Gun** (Tier 2): 10.0 DPS - 2 projectiles
3. **Triple Gun** (Tier 3): 15.0 DPS - 3 projectiles
4. **Pulse Laser** (Tier 4): 50.0 DPS - 5 projectiles, fast fire
5. **Mega Machine Gun** (Tier 5): 20.0 DPS - Very fast single shots
6. **Sniper Rifle** (Tier 6): 13.3 DPS - Penetration (15 damage through)
7. **Ultimate Gun** (Tier 7): 20.0 DPS - Massive 80px projectile, 99999 penetration

### Enemy Types (11 total)
**Basic Enemies**:
- `basic_circle_small`: 1 HP, speed 80
- `basic_circle_medium`: 2 HP, speed 75
- `basic_circle_large`: 3 HP, speed 70
- `square_small`: 2 HP, speed 90 (fast!)
- `square_medium`: 3 HP, speed 85
- `hex_small`: 3 HP, speed 70
- `hex_medium`: 4 HP, speed 65
- `hex_large`: 6 HP, speed 55

**Boss Enemies**:
- `boss_circle_tank`: 150 HP, speed 35
- `boss_square_fortress`: 200 HP, speed 30
- `boss_hex_juggernaut`: 400 HP, speed 25

### Timer Mechanics
Players must "catch" timers by moving to them while timer increments from negative to positive.
- **weapon_upgrade_timer**: Upgrades weapon tier, resets hero count to 1
- **hero_add_timer**: Adds 1 hero (more heroes = more damage)
- **rapid_hero_timer**: Faster incrementing hero timer

**Critical Balance Point**: While catching timers, player deals NO DAMAGE to enemies!

### Movement System
- 12 discrete positions arranged in an arc (Story 7.1.1 completed)
- Movement snaps between positions
- Weapons auto-target nearest enemy (centipede-like movement)

## üö® Known Issues & Considerations

### Chapter Balance
- **Chapter 3 Wave 1**: Still has spawn pressure (1.4 HP/sec short) but manageable with skill
- **Chapter 4 Wave 1**: Still has spawn pressure (2.4 HP/sec short) but much better
- **Chapter 2 Wave 1**: Has spawn pressure but considered acceptable challenge

### Spawn Pressure Concept
When `(enemy spawn rate * avg enemy HP) > player DPS`, enemies accumulate and can overwhelm player.
The analyzer script catches this with `[SPAWN PRESSURE]` warnings.

### Deployment Workflow
1. Work in `development` branch
2. Create PR to `master` when ready to deploy
3. Merge triggers GitHub Actions workflow
4. Workflow runs `npm run build` and deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages
5. **Do NOT** push directly to `master` or `development` won't auto-deploy

## üìä Chapter Progression Design

### Design Principles Used:
1. **Progressive Enemy Introduction**: Each chapter introduces 1-2 new enemy types
2. **Left/Right Pressure**: Strategic timer placement on opposite side from enemies
3. **Weapon Tier Pacing**: Weapon upgrades match enemy difficulty
4. **Boss Introduction**: Bosses appear only after player masters basic enemies
5. **Test Chapter Last**: Chapter 8 is for testing/chaos with ultimate weapon

### Chapter Theme Progression:
- Ch1-2: Learn basics, tactical positioning
- Ch3: Speed challenge (square enemies are fastest)
- Ch4: Tank challenge (large enemies with high HP)
- Ch5: Mixed combat (all basic types)
- Ch6: First boss encounter
- Ch7: Boss rush (all 3 boss types)
- Ch8: Playground (tier 7 weapon, maximum chaos)

## üéØ Next Steps / TODO

### Balance Tuning
- [ ] Consider further reducing Chapter 3 Wave 1 spawn pressure
- [ ] Test Chapter 6-8 boss encounters for player feedback
- [ ] Evaluate if tier 7 weapon is too overpowered for Chapter 8

### Features to Consider
- [ ] Add more hero types or abilities
- [ ] Create more boss types
- [ ] Add achievements/medals for chapter completion
- [ ] Implement difficulty modes (easy/normal/hard)

### Bug Watch
- [x] Game over sound looping (FIXED)
- [x] Wave complete overlay persistence (FIXED)
- [ ] Monitor for any audio memory leaks with repeated plays
- [ ] Test on mobile devices for touch controls

## üìö Important Context for AI Sessions

### Player Feedback Patterns
- User mentioned Chapter 3 Wave 1 was "impossible" ‚Üí Led to balance analyzer creation
- User found sniper rifle ineffective ‚Üí Discovered 2.5 DPS issue
- User reported overlays persisting ‚Üí Fixed cleanup in GameScene

### Testing Notes
- Balance analyzer is CRITICAL for evaluating new chapters
- Always check both overkill ratio AND spawn pressure
- Timer catch time (negative startValue) significantly impacts difficulty
- Spawn delays matter more than total enemy counts for pacing

### Code Patterns in This Project
- Phaser 3 game framework
- TypeScript with strict typing
- JSON-driven configuration (data-driven design)
- Event-based communication between systems
- Scene-based architecture (Boot ‚Üí Menu ‚Üí Game ‚Üí GameOver/ChapterComplete)
