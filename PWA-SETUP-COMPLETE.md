   - Font color: `#03DAC6`
3. Download and replace:
   - `public/icons/icon-192.png`
   - `public/icons/icon-512.png`
4. Rebuild: `npm run build`

### Deploy to Production

## 🎮 The Solution to Your Original Problem

**Your Issue:** Hero cut off at bottom because of Chrome toolbar on iPhone

**The Fix:** Installing as PWA eliminates the toolbar entirely!

**How it works:**
- **Before (Browser):** Game tries to fit in viewport → Toolbar appears/disappears → Content shifts → Hero gets cut off
- **After (PWA):** Game runs in standalone window → No toolbar ever → Full viewport available → Hero always visible

**Result:** Perfect fullscreen gaming experience! 🎉
